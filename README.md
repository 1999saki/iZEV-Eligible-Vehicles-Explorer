## 🧭 Overview

The **iZEV Explorer** is a lightweight **Python + Streamlit** web app that lets users **search, filter, and visualize** Canada’s official list of **eligible zero-emission vehicles** under the [Transport Canada iZEV Program](https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/innovative-technologies/zero-emission-vehicles/incentives-zero-emission-vehicles/eligible-vehicles).

It loads a pre-scraped CSV of all eligible vehicles and provides an intuitive dashboard where you can:

- 🔍 Filter by **Make, Model, Year, Fuel Type**, and more  
- 💰 Compare **incentive amounts** for different lease terms  
- 📅 Browse by **eligibility date range**  
- 📊 View summaries like *Top Makes*, *Fuel Mix*, and *Best Incentives*  
- 💾 Download filtered results as CSV

🧮 Features

🔹 Smart Filters
	•	Make / Model (linked): Model options change dynamically.
	•	Year range slider: Narrow down by model year.
	•	Fuel type: Filter BEV / PHEV vehicles.
	•	Eligibility date: Choose a date range using a slider.
	•	Incentive amount: Range slider for any-term incentives.
	•	Electric range ≥ 50 km: Toggle for qualifying hybrids.
	•	Free-text search: Search across all columns.

🔹 KPIs

At the top of the app:
	•	Number of Makes
	•	Number of Models
	•	Highest incentive available (any term)

🔹 Data Table
	•	Paginated, sortable, clean layout
	•	Smart column order (Year → Make → Model → Incentives → Date)
	•	Download filtered data as CSV

🔹 Summary Dashboard

Three quick insights:
	1.	Top Makes — counts, models, avg/max incentive
	2.	Fuel Mix — BEV vs PHEV breakdown
	3.	Best Incentives — top 20 vehicles by incentive value

🧰 Tech Stack

Layer	Technology	Description
Frontend / Backend	Streamlit	Interactive UI + server logic
Data Processing	Pandas	Filtering, aggregation, cleaning
Scraping	Requests, BeautifulSoup	Extracts paginated data from Transport Canada
Visualization	Streamlit built-ins	KPIs + charts
Data Format	CSV	Single dataset for fast local use


⸻

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Scraper (scraper.py) crawls all iZEV eligibility pages, cleans the tables, and saves the combined dataset to eligible_vehicles_all_pages.csv.
	2.	App (app.py) loads that CSV, detects relevant columns, and dynamically builds filters and charts.
	3.	Users interactively explore, visualize, and export results.

⸻

🚀 Deployment

You can host this app easily on:
	•	🟢 Streamlit Community Cloud — free and fast
	•	☁️ Google Cloud Run / Render / Heroku
	•	🐳 Docker — portable and production-ready

Example Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]

💡 Future Improvements
	•	🔁 Auto-refresh scraper weekly
	•	📈 Incentive trend charts
	•	🧮 Model comparison mode
	•	🌙 Dark theme & Canadian branding
